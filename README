DESCRIPTION
    Mojo::Loggly is an implementation of the Loggly API and is non-blocking
    thanks to Mojo::IOLoop from the wonderful Mojolicious framework.

    It currently sends a log event to Loggly.

    This class inherits from Mojo::EventEmitter.

EVENTS
    Mojo::Loggly inherits all events from Mojo::EventEmitter and can emit
    the following new ones.

  log
    Log

ATTRIBUTES
  config
    Holds the configuration hash.

  token
    Accesses the token element of "config". Can be overridden by the
    environment variable LOGGLY_TOKEN. This attribute is required to have a
    value.

  apiurl
    Accesses the apiurl element of "config". Can be overridden by the
    environment variable LOGGLY_APIURL.

METHODS
  log
      $self = $self->log($log, qw(tags));

    $log is either a HASH or ARRAY ref and converted to JSON, or a scalar
    and sent as plaintext.
